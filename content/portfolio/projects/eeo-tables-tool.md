During my Software Engineering Fellowship at the Census Bureau, I also significantly improved user access to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) data via the EEO Tables Tool -- more than tripling the number of data tables available for each geography.

EEO data is a custom tabulation of data from the American Community Survey used to support federal anti-discrimination policies. The EEO Tables Tool is a web app for accessing and searching through EEO data. The tool was started by another contractor, who I collaborated with to design and implement improvements that enhanced usability and extended tool functionality to support a much wider variety of data tables: increasing 6 available data tables to 20 data tables for every geography. I also collaborated with another Software Engineering Fellow on a feature for looking up metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that have been suppressed in the EEO tabulation due to not meeting data thresholds. We coded this web app in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, with the help of libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap.

The other Fellow and I presented the EEO Tables Tool Project to more than 150 Census Bureau staff and had the honor of being selected as 1 of 7 projects (out of 29 projects in total) to also present to directorate-level upper management (OPCOM).
