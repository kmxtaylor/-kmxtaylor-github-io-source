This clock mobile app provides time and date information alongside time-adaptive theming and inspirational quotes. I coded the app in React Native with Expo so that it works on both Android and iOS phones and automated testing of fundamental functionality with Jest. I queried the [IP API](http://ip-api.com/) to for the location data, the [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/) for the time/date data and the [Quotable API](https://api.quotable.io/) for the quote generation. I enjoyed the opportunity to create an aesthetically-pleasing app I could see myself and others using if I paid to publish it to the app store.
