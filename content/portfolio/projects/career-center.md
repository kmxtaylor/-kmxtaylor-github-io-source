My main project as a Software Development Intern at SPIE was modernizing the Career Center, a web application connecting over twenty-four thousand members and thousands of non-members to opportunities in the optics and photonics industry. The previous Career Center was a single huge file created by a third party that was neither responsive in UI design nor data load times, and our goal was to bring it in-house with a modern tech stack, to make it more effective for current needs and sustainable long-term.

We created a responsive single-page application (SPA) with UI components for searching for jobs, creating job posts, managing your job posts, etc. using React in TypeScript, Redux Toolkit for state management, Bootstrap for responsive UI components, HTML and CSS (with LESS, a preprocessor that extends CSS).On the back-end, we built a REST API with ASP.NET MVC in C# for our front-end to query when interacting with the database to add new job posts, search existing job posts, etc.

I collaborated closely with the other Software Development Intern in our department in the first half of my internship, distributing feature development based on availability, familiarity and interest. After that, I was the primary developer on the project, progressing it through beta testing and deployment to general availability. Throughout the development cycle, I also communicated about project requirements with project managers; refined wireframes and prototypes with UX designers in Figma and Axure RP; conducted code reviews with other developers; fixed bugs reported by QA engineers and incorporated feedback from business and sales managers.

The new Career Center received glowing feedback both within SPIE as a maintainable and scalable solution to business needs and from its ever-growing customer base as a significant upgrade in user experience and satisfaction.
