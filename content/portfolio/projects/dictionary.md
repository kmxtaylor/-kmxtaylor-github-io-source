This dictionary mobile app is a project I developed in collaboration with another student at Western Washington University. The app allows users to search wordsâ€™ definitions and pronunciation (including an audio recording of the pronunciation) and customize the font and theme. The app was created in React Native with Expo so that it works on both Android and iOS devices, and it features automated functional testing with our Jest test suite. I developed features such as the search (querying the Free Dictionary API and organizing/displaying the results) and dark/light mode functionality and my teammate developed the navigational components and some of the automated tests.
