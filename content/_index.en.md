# Hi! I'm Katie Taylor.

I'm passionate about creating and supporting human-centered, socially-responsible software solutions! I graduated from Western Washington University (WWU) with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and minors in Linguistics, Spanish, German and Honors Interdisciplinary Studies. I also had the wonderful opportunity to study abroad multiple times: in Greece (2019) and in Germany (2022).

These days, I code mostly in JavaScript / TypeScript (mainly React.js). I've also had a fair amount of previous experience with C#, Java, Python and other programming languages.

I'm also fascinated by natural languages! I've taken several courses completely in Spanish,including a university-level linguistics course. I'm currently focusing on German, and I intend to move to a German-speaking country in the not-so-near future. In addition, I've dabbled with other languages like Mandarin, Korean, Modern Greek and French.

Outside of coding and learning languages, I love music from around the world, journaling and, most of all, partner dancing -- I've enjoyed several dances but mainly fusion, salsa and some swing.
