**Hello!** My name is Katie Taylor, and I'm currently a senior at Western Washington University (WWU). I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Linguistics, German, Spanish and Honors Interdisciplinary Studies. I also work as a software developer at [WWU Residential Technology Services (ResTek)](https://housing.wwu.edu/restek).

These days, I code mostly in JavaScript (mainly Vue.js) and of course HTML/CSS as an extension of that, though also I've recently taken classes in Java and C, and I've had a fair amount of previous experience with Python. I've also dabbled with Hugo (including for this website), Jekyll, LaTeX, Racket and SAS.

I'm also fascinated by natural languages! I've taken several courses completely in Spanish,including a university-level linguistics course. I'm currently focusing on German, and I intend to eventually move to a German-speaking country. In addition, I've dabbled with Mandarin, Korean, Modern Greek and French.

Outside of coding and learning languages, I love listening to music from around the world, reflecting on life through journaling and, most of all, partner dancing (I have varying experience with various different dances, but mainly blues-fusion, salsa and some swing).
