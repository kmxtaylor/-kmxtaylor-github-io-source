**Hello!** My name is Katie Taylor, and I'm currently a junior at Western Washington University (WWU). I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Linguistics, Spanish, and Honors Interdisciplinary Studies. I also work as a software developer at [WWU Residential Technology Services (ResTek)](https://housing.wwu.edu/restek).

These days, I code mostly in JavaScript (mainly Node.js and Vue.js) and HTML/CSS, though also I've recently taken classes in Java and C, and I've had a fair amount of previous experience with Python. I've also dabbled with Hugo (including for this website), Jekyll, LaTeX, Racket, and SAS.

I'm also fascinated by natural languages: I've taken several courses completely in Spanish, including a university-level linguistics course; I'm currently learning German with the intention to eventually move to a German-speaking country; and I've dabbled with Mandarin, Korean, Modern Greek, and French.

Outside of coding and learning languages, I love listening to music from around the world, reflecting on life through journaling, and, mostly recently, dancing (swing and fusion).
