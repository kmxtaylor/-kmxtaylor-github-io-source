**Hello!** My name is Katie Taylor, and I'm currently a student at Western Washington University (WWU), graduating in December 2023. I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Linguistics, Spanish, German and Honors Interdisciplinary Studies. I also work as a software development intern at [SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics](https://spie.org/about-spie).

These days, I code mostly in JavaScript / TypeScript (mainly React.js) and of course HTML/CSS. I've also had a fair amount of previous experience in university with Java, Python and other programming languages.

I'm also fascinated by natural languages! I've taken several courses completely in Spanish,including a university-level linguistics course. I'm currently focusing on German, and I intend to move to a German-speaking country. In addition, I've dabbled with Mandarin, Korean, Modern Greek and French.

Outside of coding and learning languages, I love listening to music from around the world, reflecting on life through journaling and, most of all, partner dancing (I have varying experience with various different dances, but mainly fusion, salsa and some swing).
